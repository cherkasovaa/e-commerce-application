5. Score: 150 / 150

- [x] Application is divided to logical modules / layers. Like working with api it's separate module, as well as working with UI rendering, or working with an application state, etc. Better discuss architecture with a mentor before implementing. (40/40)
- [x] All the HTML-content is generated by JavaScript (body contains only one tag script inside). (15/30)
- [ ] Application is SPA.(0/20)
